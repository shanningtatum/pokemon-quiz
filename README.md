# pokemon-quiz

This was my first project while attending Juno College & Technology's Intro to JavaScript course. 

It is an application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PokeAPI to randomly generate Pokemon on the screen and 4 choices for user to choose. As they answer the questions correctly, it will add points until the round is over.
